# MyOutfit
MyOutfit: A React Single Page Application for shoes, consisting of a catalogue of products (shoes).

## Project Description
MyOutfit is a responsive React web application. It was made purely for educational purposes. The application features a simple product page that showcases different categories of shoes including sneakers, flats, skate shoes, and heels. It offers a filter menu that allows users to narrow down their search by various attributes such as color, price, brand, gender, and rating. Additionally, a sorting mechanism is available to sort the products by price, discount, and other criteria. Each product listing includes essential details such as price, discount (if applicable), and the name of the shoe. The application also includes a search bar to quickly find specific products.
